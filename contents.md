## Getting started
- facts, rules and queries
- recursion
- proof trees
- structured terms

----

## Logic
- propositional, relational, full
- definite clause logic
- resolution
- unification
- predicate logic*

----

## The Prolog programming model
- SLD-resolution, SLD-tree
- cut and higher-level siblings
- negation as failure

----

## Prolog programming techniques
- arithmetic
- accumulators
- second-order predicates
- meta-programming*
- methodology

----

## Knowledge representation
- trees as terms
- graphs from a predicate
- inheritance

----

## Blind search
- depth-first, breadth-first, iterative deepening
- agenda-based meta-interpreter*
- forward chaining, generating models*

----

## Informed search
- best-first search, beam search
- admissibility, monotonicity
- A* search

----

## Reasoning with natural language
- grammars, parsing as SLD-resolution
- DCG
- parsing vs generating
- getting more information out of parsing, interpretation
- question answering* -> Siri/Alexa example?

----

## Commonsense reasoning
- default reasoning*
- CWA, predicate completion*
- abduction*

----

## Inductive reasoning
- theta-subsumption, anti-unification
- bottom-up induction*
- top-down induction*

----
