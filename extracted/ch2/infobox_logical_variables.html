        Variables in clausal logic are very similar to variables in   mathematical formulas: they are placeholders that can be substituted by   arbitrary ground terms from the Herbrand universe. It is very important to   notice that <i>logical variables are   global within a clause</i> (i.e. if the variable occurs at several positions   within a clause, it should be substituted everywhere by the same term), <i>but not within a program</i>. This can be   clearly seen from the semantics of relational clausal logic, where grounding   substitutions are applied to clauses rather than programs. As a consequence,   variables in two different clauses are distinct by definition,<br>
        even if they have the same name. It will sometimes be useful to rename the   variables in clauses, such that no two clauses share a variable; this is   called <i>standardising</i>Â the clauses <i>apart</i>.
